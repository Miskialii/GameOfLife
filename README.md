<h1>Python simulatcion of "Game of life" </h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
This program is a Python implementation of Conway's Game of Life, a classic cellular automaton. The Game of Life is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input from the user. The simulation consists of a grid where each cell can be either alive or dead. The state of each cell evolves over successive generations based on a set of simple rules, that I have implemented in the code.
